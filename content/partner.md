# Partner With Us

<p class="partner-intro">
Consulting firms and MSSPs: Add a differentiated capability your competitors don't have. Gibson deploys <strong>inside</strong> client infrastructure, enabling services that cloud-hosted tools simply cannot deliver.
</p>

<div class="partner-section">

## The Problem You Solve

Every DevSecOps firm sells the same services with the same tools. Your clients need continuous security testing, but your competitors offer the exact same capabilities. Gibson changes that equation.

With Gibson, you can offer autonomous agent capabilities that run on your client's cluster, behind their firewall, in air-gapped and classified environments. No other tool on the market does this.

## How It Works

You sell the engagement. We deploy and operate Gibson. You keep the client relationship and mark it up.

<ul class="partner-benefits">
<li><span class="check">&#10003;</span> <strong>No procurement headaches</strong> — We work as your subcontractor, not a vendor your client needs to evaluate</li>
<li><span class="check">&#10003;</span> <strong>Your branded deliverables</strong> — Reports and findings go out under your name</li>
<li><span class="check">&#10003;</span> <strong>Recurring revenue</strong> — Monthly operations fees, not one-time projects</li>
<li><span class="check">&#10003;</span> <strong>Differentiated capability</strong> — Offer something nobody else can: AI agents inside the client's infrastructure</li>
<li><span class="check">&#10003;</span> <strong>Classified-ready</strong> — Gibson deploys in air-gapped, FedRAMP, ITAR, and DoD environments</li>
</ul>
