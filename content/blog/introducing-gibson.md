## Breaking the Black Box: Gibson Framework Launch

Today we're excited to announce **Gibson**, an open source framework designed specifically for AI model security research. Named after the cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson, this toolkit embodies the spirit of exploration and understanding in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI security.

## Why Gibson?

As AI models become increasingly integrated into critical systems, understanding their vulnerabilities and attack surfaces has never been more important. Gibson provides researchers with:

- **Comprehensive Attack Toolkit**: Pre-built modules for adversarial attacks, prompt injection, model extraction, and more
- **Defensive Capabilities**: Tools for hardening models against known attack vectors
- **Research Infrastructure**: Standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for security research
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom attack and defense modules

## Core Features

### 1. Adversarial Attack Generation
```python
from gibson import AdversarialEngine

engine = AdversarialEngine(model="gpt-4")
adversarial_prompt = engine.generate_attack(
    target="classification",
    method="gradient-based"
)
```

### 2. Model Vulnerability Scanning
Gibson can automatically scan models for common vulnerabilities:
- Prompt injection susceptibility
- Data leakage potential
- Adversarial robustness
- Backdoor detection

### 3. Defense Implementation
```python
from gibson.defense import ModelHardener

hardener = ModelHardener()
protected_model = hardener.apply_defenses(
    model=original_model,
    strategies=["input_sanitization", "output_filtering"]
)
```

## Getting Started

Installation is straightforward:
```bash
pip install gibson-framework
# or
git clone https://github.com/zero-day-ai/gibson
cd gibson
pip install -e .
```

## Ethical Considerations

Gibson is designed for legitimate security research and defensive purposes. We strongly encourage:
- Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities
- Testing only on models you own or have permission to test
- Contributing defensive techniques back to the community

## What's Next?

We're actively developing Gibson with the community. Upcoming features include:
- Support for multimodal models (vision, audio)
- Integration with popular ML frameworks
- Advanced evasion techniques
- Real-time monitoring capabilities

## Join the Community

Gibson is more than just a toolâ€”it's a community effort to advance AI security research. We welcome contributions, whether it's code, documentation, or research findings.

- **GitHub**: [github.com/zero-day-ai/gibson](https://github.com/zero-day-ai/gibson)
- **Documentation**: Coming soon
- **Discord**: Join our research community (link coming soon)

## Conclusion

As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the need for robust security research grows. Gibson provides the tools and infrastructure necessary to conduct this research effectively and ethically.

Stay tuned for more updates, tutorials, and research findings as we continue to develop Gibson and explore the frontiers of AI security.
