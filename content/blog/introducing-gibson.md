## Breaking the Black Box: Gibson Framework Launch

Today we're excited to announce **Gibson**, an open source framework designed specifically for AI model security research. Named after the cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson, this toolkit embodies the spirit of exploration and understanding in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI security.

## Why Gibson?

As AI models become increasingly integrated into critical systems, understanding their vulnerabilities and attack surfaces has never been more important. Gibson provides researchers with:

- **Comprehensive Attack Toolkit**: Pre-built modules for adversarial attacks, prompt injection, model extraction, and more
- **Defensive Capabilities**: Tools for hardening models against known attack vectors
- **Research Infrastructure**: Standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for security research
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom attack and defense modules

## Core Features

### 1. Modular Security Testing Architecture
Gibson uses a powerful base module system that allows for extensible security testing:
```python
from gibson.modules.base import BaseModule, ModuleResult
from gibson.models.scan import Finding

class CustomSecurityModule(BaseModule):
    name = "custom_security"
    owasp_categories = ["LLM01", "LLM07"]
    
    async def run(self, target: str, context: Dict) -> ModuleResult:
        # Implement security testing logic
        findings = []
        # Test and detect vulnerabilities
        return ModuleResult(success=True, findings=findings)
```

### 2. Advanced Prompt Injection Detection
The framework includes a sophisticated prompt injection module with external registry support:
```python
from gibson.modules.prompt_injection import PromptInjectionModule

module = PromptInjectionModule()
# Supports multiple testing modes: quick, thorough, exhaustive
# Tests against OWASP LLM01 and LLM07 categories
result = await module.run(target="https://api.example.com/llm")
```

Key capabilities:
- Dynamic prompt registry integration
- Rate-limited testing with configurable throughness
- Multiple parameter name detection (message, prompt, input, query, text)
- Confidence scoring and evidence collection
- OWASP-aligned vulnerability categorization

### 3. Module Management System
Gibson features a comprehensive module management system for organizing security tests:
```python
from gibson.services.module_manager import ModuleManager

manager = ModuleManager(context)
# Search and install modules from registry
modules = await manager.search("injection", category="llm-security")
await manager.install("advanced-jailbreak-detector")

# Enable/disable modules dynamically
await manager.enable_module("prompt_injection")
# Execute modules with automatic dependency resolution
findings = await manager.execute_module("prompt_injection", target)
```

### 4. Real-Time Security Monitoring & Logging
Gibson provides granular logging capabilities for all security modules:
- **Module-level logging**: Enable/disable logging per module
- **Finding severity tracking**: Log events by severity (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Evidence preservation**: Automatic capture of attack payloads and responses
- **Performance metrics**: Track execution duration and success rates
- **Database persistence**: SQLite-based storage for historical analysis

### 5. Extensible Finding System
```python
finding = module.create_finding(
    title="Prompt Injection Vulnerability",
    severity="high",
    confidence=80,
    evidence={"payload": malicious_prompt, "response": llm_response},
    owasp_category="LLM01",
    remediation="Implement input validation and prompt filtering"
)
```

## Getting Started

Installation is straightforward:
```bash
pip install gibson-framework
# or
git clone https://github.com/zero-day-ai/gibson-framework
cd gibson-framework
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start Example
```python
from gibson.services.module_manager import ModuleManager
from gibson.core.context import Context

# Initialize Gibson
context = Context()
manager = ModuleManager(context)
await manager.initialize()

# List available modules
modules = await manager.list_installed(category="llm-security")
for module in modules:
    print(f"{module.name}: {module.description}")

# Run a security scan
target = "https://your-llm-api.com/chat"
results = await manager.execute_module("prompt_injection", target)

# Process findings
for finding in results:
    print(f"[{finding.severity}] {finding.title}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {finding.confidence}%")
    print(f"  OWASP: {finding.owasp_category}")
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Scan a target with specific modules
gibson scan --modules prompt_injection --target https://api.example.com/llm

# Install new modules from registry
gibson module install advanced-jailbreak-detector

# List all available modules
gibson module list --category llm-security

# Enable detailed logging for specific modules
gibson config set logging.modules.prompt_injection true
```

## Ethical Considerations

Gibson is designed for legitimate security research and defensive purposes. We strongly encourage:
- Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities
- Testing only on models you own or have permission to test
- Contributing defensive techniques back to the community

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Module Discovery & Loading
Gibson employs a sophisticated module discovery system that automatically registers security modules from the filesystem:
- **Dynamic module loading**: Modules are loaded on-demand using Python's importlib
- **Hash-based integrity**: SHA256 verification ensures module integrity
- **Module manifests**: YAML-based configuration for module metadata and dependencies
- **Hot-reload support**: Modules can be updated without restarting the framework

### Database-Backed Module Registry
All modules are tracked in a SQLite database with:
- Module versioning and update tracking
- Category-based organization (llm-security, api-security, etc.)
- OWASP category mapping for compliance
- Installation timestamps and update history

### Async-First Design
The entire framework is built on async/await patterns for maximum performance:
```python
# Concurrent module execution
results = await asyncio.gather(
    module1.run(target),
    module2.run(target),
    module3.run(target)
)
```

## What's Next?

We're actively developing Gibson with the community. Upcoming features include:
- **Enhanced Prompt Registry**: Integration with community-sourced prompt databases
- **Multi-Model Testing**: Parallel testing across different LLM providers
- **Automated Report Generation**: PDF/HTML security assessment reports
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions and GitLab CI plugins
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring interface for continuous security assessment
- **Advanced Module Chaining**: Complex attack scenarios through module composition
