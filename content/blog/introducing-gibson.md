## Building the Future of AI Security Research: Gibson Framework

Today we're excited to showcase **Gibson**, a rapidly evolving open source framework specifically designed for comprehensive AI security research and testing. Built on the OWASP AI Top 10, Gibson transforms the complex landscape of AI security into actionable, systematic research workflows.

## The AI Security Challenge

As AI models become the backbone of critical applications—from healthcare systems to financial platforms—understanding their vulnerabilities has become a mission-critical requirement. Traditional security testing falls short when applied to AI systems, which require specialized knowledge of prompt injection, model theft, training data poisoning, and emergent AI-specific attack vectors.

Gibson bridges this gap by providing researchers, security teams, and developers with:

- **OWASP-Aligned Security Modules**: Production-ready modules covering the entire OWASP AI Top 10
- **Advanced Module Management System**: Database-backed registry with automated discovery, installation, and version control
- **Graph-Based Attack Analysis**: Revolutionary Neo4j integration for visualizing attack paths and conversation flows
- **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**: Async-first design built for scale, with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and comprehensive logging
- **Extensible Framework**: Developer-friendly plugin system for custom security research

## What Makes Gibson Different

### 1. Production-Ready OWASP AI Security Modules
Gibson ships with a complete suite of security modules that map directly to the OWASP AI Top 10:

- **Prompt Injection (LLM01)**: Advanced detection with multi-turn conversation analysis and dynamic payload generation
- **Insecure Output Handling (LLM02)**: Comprehensive output validation and sanitization testing
- **Training Data Poisoning (LLM03)**: Detection frameworks for compromised training datasets
- **Model Denial of Service (LLM04)**: Resource exhaustion and availability testing
- **Model Theft (LLM05)**: Advanced techniques for detecting model extraction vulnerabilities
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06)**: Systematic testing for data leakage and privacy violations
- **System Prompt Leakage**: Cutting-edge module with forensic-grade evidence collection and business impact analysis

Each module includes:
```python
from gibson.modules.prompt_injection import PromptInjectionModule

# Load and execute security module
module = await manager.load('prompt-injection')
result = await manager.execute(
    'prompt-injection', 
    'https://your-llm-api.com/chat',
    config={'thoroughness': 'exhaustive'}
)

for finding in result.findings:
    print(f"[{finding.severity}] {finding.title}")
    print(f"OWASP: {finding.owasp_category}")
    print(f"Evidence: {finding.evidence}")
```

### 2. Revolutionary Graph-Based Attack Visualization
Gibson's upcoming Neo4j integration transforms security analysis from linear log reading into interactive pattern discovery:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │ Initial Prompt  │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                    ┌────────▼────────┐
                    │  LLM Response   │
                    └────┬───────┬────┘
                         │       │
              ┌──────────▼──┐   │
              │ Benign Path │   │
              └─────────────┘   │
                                │
                    ┌───────────▼────────────┐
                    │ Escalation Vector      │ [RISK: Medium]
                    └───────────┬────────────┘
                                │
                    ┌───────────▼────────────┐
                    │ System Prompt Leakage  │ [RISK: Critical]
                    └────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Vulnerability Relationship Mapping**: Visualizes how different vulnerabilities connect and compound
- **Conversation Edge Analysis**: Identifies critical transition points where models become vulnerable
- **Exploit Pattern Recognition**: Builds knowledge graphs of successful attack techniques
- **Risk-Weighted Visualization**: Color-coded severity scoring for immediate threat assessment

```cypher
// Example: Find all conversation paths leading to successful data extraction
MATCH path = (prompt:InitialPrompt)-[:ESCALATES*]->(extraction:DataExtraction)
WHERE extraction.success = true AND extraction.severity = 'critical'
RETURN path, length(path) as attack_depth
ORDER BY attack_depth ASC
```

await manager.install("https://github.com/security-research/new-attack")
await manager.install("advanced-jailbreak-v2.1.0")

# Execute with comprehensive tracking
result = await manager.execute(
    "system-prompt-leakage",
    target="https://api.company.com/chat",
    context={"attack_intensity": "maximum"}
)

# Verify integrity and compatibility
verification = await manager.verify("sensitive-info-disclosure")
if verification['valid']:
    print(f"Module passed {len(verification['checks'])} security checks")
```

# Execute comprehensive security scan
result = await manager.execute(
    "prompt-injection",
    target="https://your-llm-api.com/chat",
    context={"attack_vectors": ["direct", "multi_turn", "evasion"]}
)

# Process findings with detailed evidence
for finding in result.findings:
    print(f"\n[{finding.severity.upper()}] {finding.title}")
    print(f"OWASP Category: {finding.owasp_category}")
    print(f"Confidence: {finding.confidence}%")
    print(f"Evidence: {finding.evidence['attack_payload'][:100]}...")
    print(f"Remediation: {finding.remediation}")
```

module_tasks = [
    manager.execute("prompt-injection", target),
    manager.execute("model-theft", target),
    manager.execute("system-prompt-leakage", target)
]

results = await asyncio.gather(*module_tasks, return_exceptions=True)

for result in results:
    if isinstance(result, Exception):
        logger.error(f"Module execution failed: {result}")
    else:
